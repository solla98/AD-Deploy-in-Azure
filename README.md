Change the private IP address on DC-1 from dynamic to static to ensure consistent network identification.

Set Client-1â€™s DNS server to the private IP of DC-1.

Log into Client-1 and verify connectivity to DC-1 via ping and DNS resolution (`ipconfig /all`).

Compare DNS configuration on DC-1 with Client-1 to ensure proper settings.

On DC-1, open Server Manager, navigate to Add Roles and Features, and install the Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) role.

Promote DC-1 to a domain controller and create a new forest: **mydomain.com**.

After the server reboots, log in as **mydomain.com\labuser** and open **Active Directory Users and Computers**.

Create Organizational Units: `_EMPLOYEES` and `_ADMINS`.

Create a user account for Jane Doe and add `jane_admin` to the **Domain Admins** group.

Log into Client-1 as the local administrator and join the machine to the domain.

Create an OU `_CLIENTS` and move Client-1 into it.
